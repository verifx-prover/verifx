/*
 * State-based implementation of a 2P2P-Graph CRDT.
 * Keeps a 2P-Set of vertices and a 2P-Set of edges.
 * Since it uses 2P-Sets removed vertices/edges cannot be added again.
 * An edge is considered in the graph if its vertices are in the graph and the edge between them is in the graph.
 * As a result, if a vertex V1 is removed while concurrently an edge V1 -> V2 is added,
 * the remove operation will win and the edge V1 -> V2 will no longer be in the graph since V1 is no longer in the graph.
